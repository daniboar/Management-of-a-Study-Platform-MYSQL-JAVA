I developed an application for managing a study platform with a partener as part of my Databases class.
In this project we implemented a database with the following users: students, teachers, admins and super-admins.
Each user has its own features such as viewing personal data, joining/exiting courses, creating/entering groups, adding/viewing grades, creating activities, etc.
This project was implemented using MySql and Java.
